Project
 
: 
 
Finding 
Artificial or Natural ripening of 
the 
fruit
 
using Image P
rocessing and IOT.
 
 
    
Objective : 
In this paper, an efficient image processing technique is used to 
detect whether the fruit is the 
 
                 
  
    
artificially ripened or naturally ripened fruit. The fruits considered here are Bananas and
 
                  
 
    
Mangoes.
 
The simulation is carried out using MATLAB tool (image processing) and 
results
 
                  
 
    
obtain has accuracy of 95%.

a complex situation happens where even an advanced autopilots systems are not able to
 
                     
 
  
manage. Artificial Intelligence based methods an

themselves to be an
 
efficient in these scenarios with uncertainties.
 
A Neural Network is used 
 
                        
to model the aircraft,
 
and a Genetic Algorithm is applied to optimize the PID controller of a 
 
                       
 
quadcopter.
